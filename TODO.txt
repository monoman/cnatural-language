Features ==============================

1 - Generic constructors
	* syntax for this and super clauses (this<T1, T2>(...))
	* syntax for new (new <T1, T2> C(...))

Issues ================================

- validate generic constraints
- create an InternalErrorException class
- test partial methods
- check that #define/#undef is used before any lexical unit
- check that enum constructors are private
- check indexers override
- test that foreach and using variables are read only
